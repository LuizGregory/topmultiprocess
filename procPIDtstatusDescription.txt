The fields are as follows:

              * Tgid: Thread group ID (i.e., Process ID).

              * Pid: Thread ID (see gettid(2)).

              * TracerPid: PID of process tracing this process (0 if not being traced).

              * Uid, Gid: Real, effective, saved set, and file system UIDs (GIDs).

              * FDSize: Number of file descriptor slots currently allocated.

              * Groups: Supplementary group list.

              * VmPeak: Peak virtual memory size.

              * VmSize: Virtual memory size.

              * VmLck: Locked memory size.

              * VmHWM: Peak resident set size ("high water mark").

              * VmRSS: Resident set size.

              * VmData, VmStk, VmExe: Size of data, stack, and text segments.
              
              * VmLib: Shared library code size.

              * SigPnd, ShdPnd: Number of signals pending for thread and for process as a whole (see pthreads(7) and sig-
                nal(7)).

              * SigBlk, SigIgn, SigCgt: Masks indicating signals being blocked, ignored, and caught (see signal(7)).

              * CapInh, CapPrm, CapEff: Masks of capabilities enabled in inheritable, permitted, and effective sets  (see
                capabilities(7)).

              * CapBnd: Capability Bounding set (since kernel 2.6.26, see capabilities(7)).

              * Cpus_allowed: Mask of CPUs on which this process may run (since Linux 2.6.24, see cpuset(7)).

              * Cpus_allowed_list: Same as previous, but in "list format" (since Linux 2.6.26, see cpuset(7)).

              * Mems_allowed: Mask of memory nodes allowed to this process (since Linux 2.6.24, see cpuset(7)).

              * Mems_allowed_list: Same as previous, but in "list format" (since Linux 2.6.26, see cpuset(7)).

              * voluntary_context_switches,  nonvoluntary_context_switches:  Number  of voluntary and involuntary context
